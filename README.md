###HTML
Edit the .html files in /jekyll-source. These are templates and can be compiled to the deploy folder by running 'jekyll build' whilst in the jekyll-source folder in the command line.

###Styles
Work with the .scss files in 'jekyll-source/_sass' these are compiled using gulp.
Run 'gulp sass' from the project root.
The styles wont be in the deploy folder until jekyll has been run

#Its all a work in progress!
It would be nice if jekyl could run using gulp.... I need to have a play around with it.

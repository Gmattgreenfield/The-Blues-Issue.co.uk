    <p>...so said the press of a Blues Issue performance supporting Stan Webb’s legendary Chicken Shack.</p>
    <p>The five chaps who comprise The Blues Issue certainly aren’t a bunch of shrinking violets. Their set scorches from skiffly roots through funky beats to stormy electric blues/rock.</p>
    <p>The slippin’n’slidin’ bass and drums, twin guitar trickery, howling harmonica all offering sterling support to Steve’s soulful vocal stylings.</p>
    <p>Some forty years ago, a teenage Steve was sneaking onto Worthing Pier to watch Stan Webb’s Chicken Shack and to fall in love with the Blues. In 2010 things came full circle when Steve led the Blues Issue playing a sizzling set as support to that same band - and as several witnesses insist – blow the headliner clean off the stage!</p>
    <p>12 years in the making! that’s how long since Steve Lambsden first got together with a bunch of low down hombres….ah, OK then, fellow blues musicians, foregoing the usual cover song formula to fully indulge his true passion – Electric Blues. Through the band’s various incarnations – including one as Stan’s Blue Notes – Steve has led varied line-ups to its present position as a premiere English hard-rockin blues outfit.</p>
    <p>Not that you’d know it if you met them in their civvies – a graphic designer, a technical resources manager, a customer services officer, a teacher and an engineer, perhaps the Ministry of Sound business card one of them presents might give a clue, But, all members of a blues band? Really?</p>
    <p>Our Leader, Singer and Guitarist - Steve Lambsden, Harpist – Tony Smith, Drummer – Matt Greenfield, Bassist – Nodd McDonagh and Singer and Guitarist – Glen McPheat, all resident on the Sussex Coast, is the latest line-up of this Blues combo.The BI has seen various different versions, ranging from an acoustic trio thro a power quartet finally to the twin guitar line-up they currently feature.</p>
    <p>This line-up has put together a much more layered sound, equally adept at the skipping skiffle roots of their eponymous opener “That Old Blues Issue” and the complicated shifts of “Whipping Post”. Glen’s angular guitar and more anxious vocal style, Tony and Nodd’s support vocal have added new dimensions to the mix. The introduction of Nodd’s EUB (Electric Upright Bass) adds another texture.</p>
    <p>Matt’s polyrhythmic punch has brought a new energy to the engine room. All of this achieved whilst maintaining the almost supernatural intuitiveness amongst the players, which has always been a hallmark of the Blues Issue that and the clears sense that they love what they do! Oh, and there’s the Acoustic BI too.</p>
    <p>They have by now played most of the usual English South Coast blues haunts, been asked to slot in behind the afore-mentioned Chicken Shack, 9 Below Zero and Doctor Feelgood and even rocked the odd university date. Their busy diary of repeat gigs bears witness to the impact of their appearances.</p>
    <p>July this year saw the release of the first BI album “Bad Day for the Blues” showcasing a wide range of Blues hues. (link) A collection of Lambsden penned originals, sprinkled with a judicious selection of standards, all given the Blues Issue kick in the ass.Largely been put together in Steve’s state-of-the-art studio suite on the West Worthing Bayou.</p>
